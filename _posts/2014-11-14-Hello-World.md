The main goals of this blog

- log my journey to becoming a competent programmer with a focus on web development. They say it takes 10,000 hours to master any skill.  Logging every hour would be excruciating so instead, posts will chart progress in the form of things I've learnt, interesting articles discovered on the web or in books.
- I plan to use the 3:2:1 principle which is a ratio for posting content.  3 is the ratio used for posting links to interesting content. 2 is for writing curated content. E.g. if I find an interesting article, rather than just post the link, there will be a summary outlining the salient points mentioned.  Finally, 1 is for original content such as code/programming concepts for discussion.
- the computer science universe is a vast landscape filled with countless diverse topics so posts may wander from my primary goal of becoming a web developer.
- to improve my communication skills in explaining technical concepts

Primarily for my reference, I have written up a [list of tasks and a timetable][1] for reviewing subjects.
